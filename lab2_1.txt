Introduction to Windows Presentation Framework and XAML

Create a new WPF project and build an Options screen in a Canvas.  Start by creating 3 Stacked Panels and use the Expander so that they can be opened and collapsed.  Note that all of these controls are actually containers for other controls (objects inside objects inside objects --  gives you the chills, eh?).

The first panel should be about the “Room Size” and include Label-TextBox pairs that set the length and width.   Include a CheckBox on this panel that has a text value of “Square It” or something like that.  Wire-up Event Handlers to your controls so that when the CheckBox is checked, the width TextBox is disabled.  Add a handler to the length TextBox change event so that, if the CheckBox is checked, it sets the value of the width TextBox equal to what is in the length.  Also, prevent user input from going negative in both TextBoxes (set them to 0 if they do).

The second panel should have a Label and ComboBox.  The Label should say “Difficulty” and the ComboBox should have items for “Easy”, “Normal”, and “Hard”.  There are no events to wire-up here.
 
The third panel should have a Label for “Player Color”, a ComboBox with items “Red”, “Blue”, “Green”, and a small Rectangle control.  Set the fill property of the Rectangle to “Red” and the ComboBox to Red as well (on startup).  Wire-up an event on the ComboBox so that it changes the Fill property of the Rectangle to whatever the user selected.

Run the program and make sure the events are firing correctly.  We will continue to add to this in future labs.
