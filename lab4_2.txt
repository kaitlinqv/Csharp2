Pig Latin Converter and String Class Methods
 
Make a new WPF application that has a TextBox for the user to enter a sentence (limit the max length of the input to 255).  Be sure to use a label with the box.   Add a Button that will RUN the converter.  Finally, include a second TextBox to display the results of the Conversion.  Make this 2nd textbox read-only.
 
For both TextBoxes, make them multi-line and wrap the text.  Refer to the following link for help:

When the RUN button is pressed, convert the userâ€™s sentence into the Pig Latin version and display it back to them in the second textbox.
 
How does Pig Latin work?  Look at Exercise 16.5 on page 667.   You will need several String Methods to do the conversion and new string building (so, use a String Builder!).
